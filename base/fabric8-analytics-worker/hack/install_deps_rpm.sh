# - We need postgresql-devel and python3-devel for psycopg2 listed in f8a_worker/requirements.txt
# - We cannot use requests from PyPI since it does not allow us to use own certificates
#   python3-pycurl is needed for Amazon SQS (boto lib), we need Fedora's rpm - installing it from pip results in NSS errors
# - Installing python-requests is a work-around for a conflict which happens when you do
#   'pip install requests; yum install python-requests' (while it's OK if you swap those)
#   It can be removed once gofedlib runs on Python 3.
